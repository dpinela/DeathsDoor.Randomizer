It also adds new configuration options to:

- Add duplicate magic and vitality shards to the pool
- Remove the Rusty Belltower Key from the pool
- Reduce the number of planted pots required to open the Green Tablet door

As the new crow items are numbered after their positions on the respective

The "Locksone Secret West" lever is now known as the "Lockstone Shrine" lever.
