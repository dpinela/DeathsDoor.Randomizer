# 1.1 (29 April 2024)

New configuration options:

- Seed input field
- Each randomizable pool can be enabled/disabled individually
- Start with a random weapon, or a weapon of your choice
- Start the game at night, or randomize between day and night
- Add duplicate life seeds to the pool, to make planting pots easier

Bug fixes:

- Logic fixes for Lost Cemetery and Inner Furnace
- There are now 50 seeds in the pool when not using the duplicate life seeds option, rather than 52
